# Enhancement One

### Artifact Selection
The artifact used in this enhancement was originally written in August 2018 for the course IT-145 Foundations in Application Development. It is a program written in Java that allows zookeepers to monitor animals and habitats. It takes user input to display information saved on a text file. 

### Justification
I chose to include this artifact to showcase innovative techniques and skills by transferring the program from Java to Python. This will also showcase my understanding of the language and its best coding practices. Being capable of successfully transferring code from one language to another is an important skill. It not only showcases the writer’s skill and education across multiple languages, but can be beneficial professionally. Companies often have various pieces of software to maintain that could be written in different languages. Having a solid understanding of how one language relates to another can aid in bringing a more cohesive understanding of how different applications can communicate with each other. 

### Reflection
Transferring from Java to Python was a bit of a challenge. The original program was written using NetBeans IDE, which I didn’t have set up for Python. I did some internet searching and found that while Python plugins are available, it isn’t supported directly by Oracle. I ended up using Visual Studio to rewrite the code in Python, as it was already set up from previous classes. I haven’t had a coding class in a while, so it took some time remembering how to set things up. Once I had the IDE situated, the actual writing into Python wasn’t overly difficult. I ended up commenting out most of the rewrite and then tested in order of execution until I was confident the entire program would work. I did not update any formatting of the outputted menus, or fix any inefficiencies, as that will be covered in my Milestone 3 enhancement plan. Doing this part of the enhancement first allowed me to see the program again and pick out any parts I want to update later. It worked as a great way to do a more in-depth review of the code.
